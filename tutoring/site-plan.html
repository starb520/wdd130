      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Who wouldn't want to learn more and spend less time on homework and studying--all for free?!?

        When I first attended college, there was a big learning curve. Classes were harder than in high school. I spent more time studying and often felt alone in my education. I was intimidated to ask my teachers for help when I got stuck. When I didn't understand something, I felt that my only option was to do what I could and accept the grade I got.
        
        Many years have passed and I'm back in school. This time I discovered a great hidden treasure--a tool available to all BYU-Idaho students. BYU-Idaho offers FREE tutoring services for most classes. If you are taking classes in Rexburg or online, you can utilize the FREE tutoring services that can help you move past road blocks and excel in your studies.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone attending BYU-Idaho or preparing to attend BYU-Idaho should be aware of the tutoring provided for their classes. It is included in the cost of tuition and it is provided throughout the semester for most classes. It can be used three times a week per class. There are a variety of tutors so find one that fits with your personality and/or study habits. You will be able to sign up for weekly tutoring appointments once you are registered for classes, though tutors sometimes take a few days to a week to make their tutoring schedules open to students to sign up. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2><strong>WHO?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Tutoring at BYU-Idaho is available to all BYU-Idaho students. Students who want to do better, learn more, spend less time frustrated will all benefit from tutoring. The tutoring is offered in person at the tutoring center on campus or online using an online platform.
      </p> 
      <h2><strong>WHAT?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Tutoring is available for many of the courses offered at BYU-Idaho. A student can receive up to three tutoring sessions a week for each of their courses that he/she is enrolled in at BYU-Idaho. The tutors are students who have previously taken the course and did well in the class. Because the tutors have previously taken the course tutors are familiar with the assignments and concepts taught in the course. Tutors encourage students to work through problems giving direction as needed and to help explain material to help extend learning.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <h2><strong>WHEN?</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Tutors open-up the times they are available, and students can go online to sign up for a time that will work with his/her schedule. Tutors do a great job opening-up multiple times on a variety of days each week making it easier to fit a tutoring session into your schedule. Because tutoring sessions can also be done using an online platform students who do not live close to BYU-Idaho have the opportunity to take advantage of these services.
